This task requires determining whether a given list of characters is a palindrome; that is, whether the sequence reads the same forward and backward.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of:  
• x: A list of characters (List Char). The list can be empty or non-empty.

-----Output-----  
The output is a Boolean value (Bool):  
• Returns true if the input list is a palindrome.  
• Returns false otherwise.

-----Note-----  
An empty list is considered a palindrome. The function does not impose any additional preconditions.
