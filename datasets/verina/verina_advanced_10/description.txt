-----Description-----  
his task requires writing a Lean 4 method decomposes a natural number `n` into its prime factorization components based on a user-provided list of primes. Specifically, it calculates the exponents for each prime in the factorization such that:
\[ n = \prod p^e \]
In other words, it determines the exponent e for each prime p.

-----Input-----
The input consists of:
- n: A positive natural number (n > 0) that can be expressed as a product of powers of the given primes.
- primes: A non-empty list of distinct prime numbers whose product of powers equals n.  

-----Output-----  
The output is `List (Nat × Nat)`:
Return a list of pair/Cartesian product of two natural numbers (p, e), where p is the prime and e is the exponent of p in the factorization. Each prime in the output must be from the input list, and every prime in the input list must appear in the output.
