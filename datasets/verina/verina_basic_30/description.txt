-----Description----- 
This task requires writing a Lean 4 method that computes the element-wise modulo between two arrays of integers. The method should produce a new array where each element is the remainder after dividing the corresponding element from the first array by the element from the second array.

-----Input----- 
The input consists of:
a: An array of integers.
b: An array of integers.

-----Output----- 
The output is an array of integers:
Returns a new array in which each element is the result of taking the modulo of the corresponding elements from the two input arrays.

-----Note----- 
Preconditions:
- Both arrays must be non-null.
- Both arrays must have the same length.
- All elements in the second array should be non-zero.

Postconditions:
- The length of the resulting array is the same as the length of the input arrays.
- Each element in the resulting array is the modulo of the corresponding elements in the input arrays.
