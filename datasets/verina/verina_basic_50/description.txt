-----Description-----  
This task is about calculating the absolute value of an integer. The goal is to determine the non-negative value of a given integer: if the integer is non-negative, it remains unchanged; if it is negative, its positive counterpart is returned.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of:  
• x: An integer.

-----Output-----  
The output is an integer that represents the absolute value of the input. Specifically:  
• If x is non-negative, the output is x.  
• If x is negative, the output is the negation of x (that is, a value y such that x + y = 0).

-----Note-----  
This function should correctly handle zero, positive, and negative integers.
