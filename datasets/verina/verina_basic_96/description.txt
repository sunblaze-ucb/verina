-----Description-----  
This task requires swapping two integer values. Given two integers as input, the objective is to produce an output where their order is reversed: the first element of the output corresponds to the second input and the second element corresponds to the first input.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of two integers:  
• X: An integer value.  
• Y: Another integer value.

-----Output-----  
The output is a tuple (Int × Int) where:  
• The first element is equal to Y.  
• The second element is equal to X.

-----Note-----  
There are no additional preconditions for this task. The function simply returns a swapped tuple of its two input integers.
