-----Description---
This task requires writing a Lean 4 method that's goal is to determine the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to make the array semi-ordered. You may repeatedly swap 2 adjacent elements in the array. A permutation is called semi-ordered if the first number equals 1 and the last number equals n.

-----Input-----

The input consists of:
- nums: A permutation of [1, 2, ..., n] where n is the length of the list (all distinct integers in range [1, n]).

----Output-----

The output is an integer representing the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed.
