-----Description-----  
This task involves determining the triple of a given integer. The goal is to create a function that, for any integer provided as input, returns a value equal to three times that integer, including handling the case when the input is zero.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of:  
• x: An integer.

-----Output-----  
The output is an integer that represents three times the input integer.  
• If x = 0, the output will be 0.  
• Otherwise, the output will be computed as x + 2 * x, which is equivalent to 3 * x.

-----Note-----  
There are no additional preconditions. It is assumed that x is a valid integer.
