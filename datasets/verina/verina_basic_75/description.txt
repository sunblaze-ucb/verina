-----Description-----  
This task involves finding the minimum element in a non-empty array of integers. The goal is to identify and return the smallest number present in the array.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of:  
• a: An array of integers (the array is assumed to be non-empty).

-----Output-----  
The output is an integer that:  
• Is the smallest element from the input array.  
• Satisfies the property that it is less than or equal to every element in the array and is exactly equal to at least one element of the array.

-----Note-----  
It is assumed that the input array contains at least one element. The implementation uses a helper function (loop) to recursively compare elements and determine the minimum value.
