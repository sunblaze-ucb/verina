-----Description-----  
This task focuses on determining if a given integer is even. The problem requires checking whether the integer can be represented as twice another integer, meaning it is divisible by 2 without any remainder.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of a single integer:  
• x: An integer to be evaluated.

-----Output-----  
The output is a boolean value:  
• true if x is even (x mod 2 equals 0).  
• false if x is odd.

-----Note-----  
No additional preconditions are required. The method should work correctly for any integer value.
