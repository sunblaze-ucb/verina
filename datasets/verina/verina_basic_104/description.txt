-----Description-----  
This problem involves combining two maps by creating a new map that includes every key from both inputs. When a key is found in both maps, the value from the second map is used in the result.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of:  
• m1: A Map (represented as a list of key-value pairs) where each key is of type Int and each value is of type Int.  
• m2: A Map (similarly represented) where keys may overlap with m1.

-----Output-----  
The output is a Map that meets the following conditions:  
• Every key present in m2 is present in the result.  
• Every key present in m1 is also present in the result.  
• For keys that appear in both maps, the resulting value is the one from m2.  
• For keys that appear only in m1, the resulting value remains unchanged.  
• No keys outside those present in m1 or m2 are included in the result.
• The entries in the map should be sorted

-----Note-----  
It is assumed that the Map structure ensures key uniqueness in the final result using BEq for key comparison.
