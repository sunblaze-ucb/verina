-----Description-----  
The task is to determine whether there exists at least one pair of different floating-point numbers in a list such that the absolute difference between them is less than a given threshold. The focus is solely on deciding if such a pair is present in the list.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of:  
• numbers: A list of floating-point numbers.  
• threshold: A floating-point number representing the maximum allowed difference between two numbers for them to be considered "close."  

-----Output-----  
The output is a boolean value:  
• true – if there exists at least one pair of distinct elements in the list such that the absolute difference between them is less than the threshold.  
• false – if for every possible pair of elements, the absolute difference is greater than or equal to the threshold.

-----Note-----  
It is assumed that the list of numbers is provided and that the threshold is non-negative.
