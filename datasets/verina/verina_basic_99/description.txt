-----Description-----  
This task requires computing three times the given integer. The goal is to determine the product of the input integer and 3.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of:  
• x: An integer.

-----Output-----  
The output is an integer that represents three times the input value.

-----Note-----  
The implementation uses two different branches based on the value of x (i.e., x < 18 or x ≥ 18), but both branches guarantee that the result equals 3*x.
