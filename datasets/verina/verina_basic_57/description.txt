-----Description-----
This task involves determining how many numbers within an array are less than a specified threshold. The problem is focused on identifying and counting such numbers based purely on their value in relation to the threshold.

-----Input-----
The input consists of:
• numbers: An array of integers (which may be empty or non-empty).
• threshold: An integer that serves as the comparison threshold.

-----Output-----
The output is a natural number (Nat) representing the count of elements in the array that are less than the given threshold.

-----Note-----
There are no additional preconditions; the function should work correctly for any array of integers and any integer threshold.
