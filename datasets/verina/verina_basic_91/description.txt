-----Description-----  
This task involves creating a function that swaps two integer values. Given two integers, the function should return a pair where the first element is the second input value and the second element is the first input value.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of two integers:  
• X: An integer representing the first value.  
• Y: An integer representing the second value.

-----Output-----  
The output is a pair (Int × Int) that:  
• Contains the original Y as the first element.  
• Contains the original X as the second element.

-----Note-----  
There are no additional preconditions. The function simply swaps the two input values.
