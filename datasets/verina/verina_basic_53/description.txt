-----Description-----
This problem asks for a method to determine the sum of the first N natural numbers. The task focuses on computing the total when given an input N, ensuring that the value is 0 when N is 0 and correctly calculated for positive values of N.

-----Input-----
The input consists of:
â€¢ N: A natural number (Nat) representing the count of the first natural numbers to sum.

-----Output-----
The output is a natural number (Nat), which is the sum of the first N natural numbers computed as: N * (N + 1) / 2.

-----Note-----
The computation leverages a recursive implementation. There are no additional preconditions beyond providing a valid natural number.
