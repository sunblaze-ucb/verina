-----Description-----
This task requires writing a Lean 4 method that implementing the "Two Sum" problem. Given a list of integers
and a target integer, the function should return the indices of the two numbers that add up to
the target. If no valid pair exists, the function should return none. And the indices returned must
be within the bounds of the list. If multiple pairs exist, return the lexicographically first pair (i, j),
meaning the pair with the smallest i, and among those, the smallest j.

-----Input-----
- nums: A list of integers.
- target: An integer representing the target sum.

-----Output-----
- An option type containing a pair of natural numbers (indices) such that
  nums[i] + nums[j] = target with i < j, if such a pair exists. Otherwise, it returns none.
  The pair returned must be lexicographically first among all valid pairs.
