-----Description-----
This task involves taking an array as input and producing a new array that has the same size and identical elements in the same order as the input.

-----Input-----
The input consists of:
• s: An array of elements (for testing purposes, assume an array of integers, i.e., Array Int).

-----Output-----
The output is an array of the same type as the input:
• The output array has the same size as the input array.
• Each element in the output array is identical to the corresponding element in the input array.

-----Note-----
There are no special preconditions for the input array (it can be empty or non-empty); the function simply performs a straightforward copy operation on the array.
