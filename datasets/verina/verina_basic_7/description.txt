-----Description----- 
This task requires writing a Lean 4 method that computes the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers. The result should match the formula: (n * (2 * n - 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 3.

-----Input-----
The input consists of:
n: A natural number representing the count of odd natural numbers to consider (n should be non-negative).

-----Output-----
The output is a natural number:
Returns the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers, as defined by the formula: (n * (2 * n - 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 3.
