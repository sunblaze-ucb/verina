-----Input-----  
The input consists of two integers:  
• X: The first integer.  
• Y: The second integer.

-----Output-----  
The output is a tuple of two integers (Int × Int) where:  
• The first element is equal to Y.  
• The second element is equal to X.

-----Note-----  
There are no restrictions on the input values. The function must correctly swap the inputs regardless of whether they are positive, negative, or zero.
