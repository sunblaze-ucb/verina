-----Description-----  
This task involves concatenating two arrays of integers by appending the second array to the end of the first array. The goal is to produce a new array that sequentially contains all elements from the first array followed by all elements from the second array.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of two parameters:  
• a: An Array of integers representing the first part of the concatenated array.  
• b: An Array of integers representing the second part of the concatenated array.

-----Output-----  
The output is an Array of integers that satisfies the following:  
• The length of the output array is equal to the sum of the lengths of arrays a and b.  
• The first part of the output array (indices 0 to a.size - 1) is identical to array a.  
• The remaining part of the output array (indices a.size to a.size + b.size - 1) is identical to array b.

-----Note-----  
No additional preconditions are required since the function uses the sizes of the input arrays to build the resulting array.
