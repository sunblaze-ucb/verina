-----Description-----  
This task is about processing an array of integers by producing a new array that excludes the first element. The objective is to define a clear behavior: if the array contains at least one element, return a modified array starting from the second element.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of:  
• a: An array of integers.

-----Output-----  
The output is an array of integers that:  
• Has a length equal to the original array's length minus one.  
• Contains the same elements as the input array except for the first element.  
• Satisfies the condition that for every index i in the output array, the element at position i is equal to the element at position i+1 in the input array.

-----Note-----  
It is assumed that the input array is non-empty.
