-----Description-----  
This problem focuses on reversing an array of integers. The goal is to take an input array and produce a new array with the elements arranged in the reverse order.  

-----Input-----  
The input consists of:  
• a: An array of integers, which may be empty, contain one element, or many elements.

-----Output-----  
The output is an array of integers that:  
• Has the same length as the input array.  
• Contains the same elements as the input array, but in reverse order.  
• For every valid index i in the input array, the output at index i is equal to the element at index (a.size - 1 - i) from the input array.

-----Note-----  
There are no specific preconditions; the method should correctly handle any array of integers.
