-----Description-----  
The task is to compute the element-wise sum of two integer arrays. The result should be a new array where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the two input arrays. The problem assumes that both arrays have the same length.

-----Input-----  
The input consists of two parameters:  
• a: An array of integers.  
• b: An array of integers.  
Note: Both arrays must have the same length.

-----Output-----  
The output is an array of integers that:  
• Has the same size as the input arrays.  
• Contains elements where each element at index i is computed as a[i]! + b[i]! from the input arrays.

-----Note-----  
It is assumed that the two input arrays have equal lengths.
